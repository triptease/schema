## Welcome to structured-data.triptease.io

### Overview

[Schema.org](http://schema.org/) contains a rich vocabulary that can be used to help tools read and understand web pages in wide number of domains. 
This page details the markup that can be added to a hotel website for the benefit of not only Triptease products but also your SEO and Google listings.  

If you notice anything wrong please raise an [issue](https://github.com/triptease/structured-data/issues). 

### Microdata vs RDFa vs JSON-LD

If the markup is static (like your hotel name and address) then JSON-LD is generally the easiest to test and debug, while if the meta data is more dynamic (like offers or rate details) 
you may want to use the microdata format embedded in the HTML so that you keep the UI in sync with the meta data.

Triptease supports all three formats so if you are already using one then donâ€™t worry about switching.

### Getting started

There are different levels of support for meta-data, it's best to start with the simplest and work your way up to more advanced features as you get more comfortable. 

* [Identification](#identification)
* [Reservation](#reservation)
* [Lodging Search](#lodging-search)
* [Offers for Hotel Rooms](#offers-for-hotel-rooms)

Advanced
* [No availability](#no-availability)
* [Application details](#application-details)


### Identification

*If you are already using another form of identification (apiKeys, propertyCodes etc) then you can safely skip this step*

This is the simplest and most important meta data you can add through out your marketing website and booking engine. Ideally you want this on every page. 
Doing this will automatically allow your hotel to appear on Google search pages and Google Maps. Just putting the hotel name and @type on each page will help Triptease identify your hotel automatically 

#### JSON-LD Example

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
 "@context": "http://schema.org",
 "@type": "Hotel",
 "name": "Sea View Hotel",
 "identifier": "1234567",
 "brand": "Great Escapes",
 "address": 
  {
  "@type": "PostalAddress",
  "streetAddress": "1 Piccadilly",
  "addressLocality": "St. James's",
  "addressRegion": "London",
  "postalCode": "W1 9B",
  "addressCountry": "United Kingdom"
  },
  "geo": {
      "@type": "GeoCoordinates",
      "latitude": "15.234",
      "longitude": "-80.3242"
  },
 "telephone": "+44 1234 5678",
 "image": "http://example.com/image.png",
 "url": "http://example.com/"
}
</script>
```

#### Microdata Example

```html
<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Hotel">
    <h1 itemprop="name">Sea View Hotel</h1>
    <span itemprop="identifier">123456</span>
    <h2 itemprop="brand">Great Escapes</h1>
    <div itemprop="address" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/PostalAddress">
        <span itemprop="streetAddress">1 Piccadilly</span>
        <span itemprop="addressLocality">St. James's</span>
        <span itemprop="addressRegion">London</span>
        <span itemprop="postalCode">W1 9B</span>
        <span itemprop="addressCountry">United Kingdom</span>
    </div>
     <div itemprop="geo" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/GeoCoordinates">
        latitude:<span itemprop="latitude">15.234</span>, 
        longitude:<span itemprop="longitude">-80.3242</span>
    </div>
 <div>Telephone: <span itemprop="telephone">+44 1234 5678</span></div>
 <div>
    <a href="http://example.com/" itemprop="url">
        <img itemprop="image" src="http://example.com/image.png"/>
    </a>
 </div>
</div>
```

Lets walk through this:

#### @type

Make sure you set this to [Hotel](https://schema.org/Hotel), [LodgingBusiness](https://schema.org/LodgingBusiness) or [BedAndBreakfast](https://schema.org/BedAndBreakfast) rather than the more generic [WebSite](https://schema.org/WebSite), [LocalBusiness](https://schema.org/LocalBusiness) or [Organization](https://schema.org/Organization).

### Reservation

After identifying the hotel, the next-most important data you can provide is the reservation information after a customer completes their booking. If you support multi room booking just repeat the script tag  or itemScope root element (use an array in JSON-LD).

*Used by: Triptease*

#### JSON-LD Example

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "http://schema.org",
  "@type": "LodgingReservation",
  "reservationId": "abc456",
  "reservationStatus": "http://schema.org/ReservationConfirmed",
  "checkinTime": "2017-04-11T16:00:00-00:00",
  "checkoutTime": "2017-04-13T11:00:00-00:00",
  "totalPrice": "800.00",
  "basePrice": "750.00",
  "priceCurrency": "GBP"
}
</script>
```

#### Microdata Example

```html
<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/LodgingReservation">
    <h1>Reservation #<span itemprop="reservationId">abc456</span></h1>
    <h2>Details</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>Status</dt>
        <dd itemprop="reservationStatus" content="http://schema.org/ReservationConfirmed">Confirmed</dd>
        <dt>Checkin</dt>
        <dd itemprop="checkinTime" content="2017-04-11T16:00:00-00:00">On 11th April from 4pm</dd>
        <dt>Checkout</dt>
        <dd itemprop="checkoutTime" content="2017-04-13T11:00:00-00:00">On 13th April by 11am</dd>
        <dt>Total</dt>
        <dd><span itemprop="totalPrice">800.00</span> <span itemprop="priceCurrency">GBP</span></dd>
        <dd><span itemprop="basePrice">750.00</span> <span>GBP</span></dd>
    </dl>
</div>
```

Lets walk through this:

#### @type

Set this to [LodgingReservation](https://schema.org/LodgingReservation) 


#### reservationId

The [reservationId](https://schema.org/reservationId) should be unique and verifiable.  


#### reservationStatus

The [reservationStatus](https://schema.org/reservationStatus) should be set to [ReservationConfirmed](https://schema.org/ReservationConfirmed). 
If you wish to expose reservations earlier in the funnel then make sure you use one of the other [ReservationStatusType](https://schema.org/ReservationStatusType).


#### checkinTime

The [checkinTime](https://schema.org/checkinTime) is a combination of date and time. It cannot be just a time (despite what the name suggests).

Ensure this is in the [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) format (YYYY-MM-DD).
So 9th April 2020 would become `2020-04-09`


#### checkoutTime

The [checkoutTime](https://schema.org/checkoutTime) is a combination of date and time. It cannot be just a time (despite what the name suggests).

Ensure this is in the [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) format (YYYY-MM-DD).
So 9th April 2020 would become `2020-04-09`

#### totalPrice

The [totalPrice](https://schema.org/totalPrice) is the total price for the duration of the stay *including* taxes etc. It does not include the currency symbol.

#### basePrice (Optional)

The basePrice is the base price for the duration of the stay *excluding* taxes etc. It does not include the currency symbol.

#### priceCurrency

The [priceCurrency](https://schema.org/priceCurrency) is the three digit ISO currency code. 



### Lodging Search

*Used by: Triptease*

These are the parameters the customer searched with. [schema.org](http://www.schema.org/) does not directly model these concepts so TripTease has made a small extension to capture
these additional parameters while trying to keep to the same naming conventions and domain language.

#### JSON-LD Example

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://structured-data.triptease.io",
  "@type": "LodgingSearch",
  "checkinTime": "2017-04-11T12:00:00-00:00",
  "checkoutTime": "2017-04-13T12:00:00-00:00",
  "numAdults": "2",
  "numChildren": "0",
  "numRooms": "1"
}
</script>
```

#### Microdata Example

```html
<div itemscope itemtype="https://structured-data.triptease.io/LodgingSearch">
    <meta itemprop="checkinTime" content="2017-04-11T12:00:00-00:00"/>
    <meta itemprop="checkoutTime" content="2017-04-13T12:00:00-00:00"/>
    <meta itemprop="numAdults"  content="2"/>
    <meta itemprop="numChildren" content="0"/>
    <meta itemprop="numRooms" content="1"/>
</div>
```

Lets walk through this:

#### @context

Set this to https://structured-data.triptease.io 

#### @type

Set this to LodgingSearch* 

#### checkinTime

The [checkinTime](https://schema.org/checkinTime) is a combination of date and time. 
We are using the same property as defined for a [LodgingReservation](https://schema.org/LodgingReservation) for consistency even though we are actually only interested in the date part. 

#### checkoutTime

The [checkoutTime](https://schema.org/checkoutTime) is a combination of date and time. 
We are using the same property as defined for a [LodgingReservation](https://schema.org/LodgingReservation) for consistency even though we are actually only interested in the date part.

#### numAdults (Optional)

The [numAdults](https://schema.org/numAdults) is the total number of adults that were searched for. Defaults to 2

#### numChildren (Optional)

The [numChildren](https://schema.org/numChildren) is the total number of children that were searched for. Defaults to 0

#### numRooms (Optional)

The numRooms* is the total number of rooms that were searched for. Defaults to 1

**A Triptease extension*


### Offers for Hotel Rooms

*Used by: Triptease*

These are the offer or rooms and rates the hotel has available for the specified search parameters. 
[schema.org](http://www.schema.org/) models this around [offers](http://schema.org/Offer) for [hotel rooms](http://schema.org/HotelRoom). This image explains the concept:
                                                                                        
![Schema Diagram showing the relationship between entities](https://schema.org/docs/schema_hotels_1.png)

Multiple offers can added to a page either inside a single script tag containing an array or multiple script/div tags etc.

#### JSON-LD Example

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "http://schema.org/",
  "@type": "Offer",
  "itemOffered": {
    "@type": "HotelRoom",
    "name": "Deluxe Double",
    "identifier": "DD-001"
  },
  "name": "Best Available Rate",
  "identifier": "BAR-001",
  "priceSpecification": {
    "@type": "UnitPriceSpecification",
    "price": "99.00",
    "priceCurrency": "USD",
    "unitText": "Nightly"
  }
}
</script>
```

#### Microdata Example

```html
<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Offer">
  <div itemprop="itemOffered" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/HotelRoom">
      <span itemprop="name">Deluxe Double</span>
      <meta itemprop="identifier" content="DD-001">
  </div>
  <span itemprop="name">Best Available Rate</span>
  <meta itemprop="identifier" content="BAR-001">
  <span itemprop="priceSpecification" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/UnitPriceSpecification">
    <meta itemprop="price" content="99.00">$99.00
    <meta itemprop="priceCurrency" content="USD">
    <meta itemprop="unitText" content="Nightly">per night
  </span>
</div>
```

Lets walk through this:

#### @type

Set this to [Offer](http://schema.org/Offer) 

#### itemOffered

The [itemOffered](https://schema.org/itemOffered) should link to a [HotelRoom](https://schema.org/HotelRoom) with a room [name](https://schema.org/name) or type and optional [identifier](https://schema.org/identifier) for the room code.

#### name

The [name](https://schema.org/name) should contain the rate name

#### identifier (Optional) 

The [identifier](https://schema.org/identifier) can be used to set a rate code

#### priceSpecification

The [priceSpecification](https://schema.org/UnitPriceSpecification) contains the [price](https://schema.org/price) and [currency](https://schema.org/currency):
 
price: The numeric value of the offer

currency: The 3 character currency code of the offer

unitText (optional): "Total" if the price is for the entire stay. "Nightly" if the price is per night. Defaults to "Nightly".
